# Services Directory

This directory contains service implementations that provide business logic and data access functionality.

## Structure

- Service implementations should implement their corresponding interfaces from the `interfaces` directory
- Services should follow the Single Responsibility Principle
- Services should be registered with the ServiceLocator for dependency injection

## Services to be implemented:

1. **ResponsiveService** - Implements IResponsiveService for screen size detection and responsive calculations
2. **NavigationService** - Implements INavigationService for navigation management
3. **ContentService** - Implements IContentService for content management

Each service will be implemented in subsequent tasks according to the MVVM architecture and SOLID principles.
